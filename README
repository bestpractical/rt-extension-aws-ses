NAME
    RT::Extension::AWS::SES - Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)
    compatibility

DESCRIPTION
    Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) (<http://aws.amazon.com/ses/>) is a
    highly scalable and cost-effective bulk and transactional email-sending
    service for businesses and developers. Part of Amazon web services (AWS)
    infrastructure.

    This RT extension helps overcome some restrictions of SES.

  Email headers
    SES restricts email headers to RFC822, everything else should be
    prefixed with 'X-'. This is not required by newer RFCs that obsolete
    RFC822, but RFC822 is still called standard while the rest are proposals
    or drafts.

    List of allowed headers you can find in documentation -
    <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/header-fields.html
    >.

    For RT this means that some fields will be prefixed with "X-" prefix,
    for example "RT-Ticket". This may be important to recipients who use
    such headers for automation.
